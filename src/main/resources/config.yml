  # Interval for automatically saving the force-loaded chunks data to active_chunks.json.
  # Measured in minutes. (20 ticks = 1 second)
  auto-save-interval-minutes: 5

  # Interval for the periodic consistency check.
  # This check verifies if chunks marked for force-loading still contain tick-worthy blocks in their PDC.
  # Measured in hours.

# Settings for the server hibernation feature.
# When the server is empty, the plugin can unload all chunks to save resources.
hibernation:
  # Set to true to enable this feature.
  enabled: true
  # How long the server must be empty before chunks are unloaded.
  # Measured in minutes.

  # How many chunks to reload at a time when a player joins an empty server.
  # Higher values reload faster but may cause more lag.
  reload-chunks-per-batch: 5
  # How often (in ticks) to process a batch of chunks for reloading. 20 ticks = 1 second.
  # A value of 5 means a batch is reloaded every 5 ticks.

# List of materials that, when placed by a player, should make their chunk tick-worthy and force-loaded.
# Only block entities (TileEntities) that perform continuous operations are typically needed here.
# Ensure material names are valid Minecraft Material enums (case-insensitive in plugin, but use uppercase for clarity).

# Suggestion for server owners:
# Consider lowering your server's 'simulation-distance' in server.properties
# to a value like 4-8, and let this plugin manage persistent ticking for machines.
# This can significantly improve overall server performance.
